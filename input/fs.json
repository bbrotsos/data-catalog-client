This includes performing soil improvement and watershed restoration, wildlife habitat improvement, control of insects, disease, and noxious weeds, tree planting, seeding and other cultural treatments necessary to maintain and improve land productivity. Since its creation millions of acres of National Forest System lands (NFS) have been treated and restored to resilient conditions and terrestrial and aquatic habitat improved. Public Law 109-54 of August 2, 2005, Title IV �General Provisions, Sec 412 further amended the K-V Act to allow the collection and use of CWKV funds for watershed restoration, wildlife habitat improvement, to prepare timber sales, control of insects, disease, and noxious weeds, fire community protection activities, and the maintenance of forest roads within the Forest Service region in which the timber sale occurred. Provided that such activities may be performed through the use of contracts, forest product sales, and cooperative agreements. Note that these activities are to be performed by contract and not Forest Service personnel. The Forest Service used this amendment to administratively create two K-V programs within the K-V fund; CWKV (Cooperative Work, Knutson-Vandenberg, Sale Area Projects) and CWK2 (Cooperative Work, Knutson-Vandenberg, Regional Projects). This layer shows the spatial representation where activities accomplished and funded with CWKV and CWK2 funds and reported through the Forest Service Activity Tracking System (FACTS) database. It is important to note that this layer may not contain all CWKV or CWK2 accomplished activities; the spatial portion of the activity description is not currently enforced by FACTS and at this time some are optionally reported by Forest Service units. As spatial data reporting is enforced by the application and acceptant of reporting both tabular and spatial we hope to improve the quality and comprehensiveness of the data used for this layer in coming years.�<a href=\"https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.Activity_KnutsonVandenberg.xml\" target=\"_blank\">Metadata</a>","keyword":["Knutson Vangenberg Act","Recovery","Activities","Resiliency","Safety","environment","Forest Management","Open Data"],"issued":"2017-05-03T17:58:43.000Z","modified":"2018-02-22T02:54:17.852Z","publisher":{"name":"U.S. Forest Service"},"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"USFS AGOL Admin","hasEmail":"mailto:ebaiello@fs.fed.us"},"accessLevel":"public","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"ArcGIS Open Dataset","format":"Web page","mediaType":"text/html","accessURL":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f7dafcc811204aeeb3712b753851cbdd_8"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Esri Rest API","format":"Esri REST","mediaType":"application/json","accessURL":"https://apps.fs.usda.gov/arcx/rest/services/EDW/EDW_KnutsonVandenberg_01/MapServer/8"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"GeoJSON","format":"GeoJSON","mediaType":"application/vnd.geo+json","downloadURL":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f7dafcc811204aeeb3712b753851cbdd_8.geojson"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"CSV","format":"CSV","mediaType":"text/csv","downloadURL":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f7dafcc811204aeeb3712b753851cbdd_8.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"KML","format":"KML","mediaType":"application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml","downloadURL":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f7dafcc811204aeeb3712b753851cbdd_8.kml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Shapefile","format":"ZIP","mediaType":"application/zip","downloadURL":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f7dafcc811204aeeb3712b753851cbdd_8.zip"}],"landingPage":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f7dafcc811204aeeb3712b753851cbdd_8","webService":"https://apps.fs.usda.gov/arcx/rest/services/EDW/EDW_KnutsonVandenberg_01/MapServer/8","license":"https://hub.arcgis.com/api/v2/datasets/f7dafcc811204aeeb3712b753851cbdd_8/license","spatial":"-127.112,23.911,-74.729,49.856","theme":["geospatial"]},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","identifier":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/9bcbf723aafe4041a8047c290d19feec_3","title":"Integrated Resource Restoration (IRR): Polygon (Feature Layer)","description":"Depicts the area of activities funded through the NFRR Budget Line Item and reported through the FACTS database.

Forests and/or regions have had the opportunity to modify the default NHD water representation (300ft buffer from all water features) for their areas of interest to accurately represent aerial fire retardant avoidance areas as described in the 2011 Record of Decision for the Nationwide Aerial Application of Fire Retardant on National Forest System Land EIS. These changes have been integrated into this dataset depicting aerial fire retardant avoidance areas for hydrographic features. The following process was used to develop the hydrographic areas to be avoided by aerial fire retardant. Initially, all intermittent/ephemeral and perennial features were buffered by 300 feet by the Forest/Region units. Subsequently, Forest/Region units may have extended these buffers locally based on their requirements. There may be overlapping features that have been created during the buffering process, so one must dissolve features before calculating any area values. Data is symbolized by FCODE. Using the FCODE attribute, streams/rivers/waterbodies are categorized into perennial and intermittent/ephemeral types. Avoidance features (streams and rivers) with FCODES 46003 and 46007, as well as features (lakes and other waterbody) with FCODES 39001, 39005, 39006, 43614, 46601 are considered intermittent/ephemeral features. All other FCODES are considered to be perennial features. All underground and covered water features (e.g., pipelines) are excluded. When symbolizing this information, perennial features should be drawn on top of intermittent/ephemeral features to give the proper message. Data displays at scales larger than 1:1,250,000. Data uses a Web Mercator projection. The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist.

Forests and/or regions have had the opportunity to modify the default NHD water representation (300ft buffer from all water features) for their areas of interest to accurately represent aerial fire retardant avoidance areas as described in the 2011 Record of Decision for the Nationwide Aerial Application of Fire Retardant on National Forest System Land EIS. These changes have been integrated into this dataset depicting aerial fire retardant avoidance areas for hydrographic features. The following process was used to develop the hydrographic areas to be avoided by aerial fire retardant. Initially, all intermittent/ephemeral and perennial features were buffered by 300 feet by the Forest/Region units. Subsequently, Forest/Region units may have extended these buffers locally based on their requirements. There may be overlapping features that have been created during the buffering process, so one must dissolve features before calculating any area values. Data is symbolized by FCODE. Using the FCODE attribute, streams/rivers/waterbodies are categorized into perennial and intermittent/ephemeral types. Avoidance features (streams and rivers) with FCODES 46003 and 46007, as well as features (lakes and other waterbody) with FCODES 39001, 39005, 39006, 43614, 46601 are considered intermittent/ephemeral features. All other FCODES are considered to be perennial features. All underground and covered water features (e.g., pipelines) are excluded. When symbolizing this information, perennial features should be drawn on top of intermittent/ephemeral features to give the proper message. Data displays at scales larger than 1:1,250,000. Data uses a Web Mercator projection. The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee. <a href=\"https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_R06.AFRAA_Hydro.xml\" target=\"_blank\">Metadata</a>","keyword":["Inland Waters","Fire and Aviation","Aerial","Retardant Avoidance","Hydrographic","AFRAA","Open Data"],"issued":"2017-03-27T22:01:50.000Z","modified":"2018-02-07T17:34:31.709Z","publisher":{"name":"U.S. Forest Service"},"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"USFS AGOL Admin","hasEmail":"mailto:ebaiello@fs.fed.us"},"accessLevel":"public","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"ArcGIS Open Dataset","format":"Web page","mediaType":"text/html","accessURL":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/839b839dc864470e8d5fc12d883e4546_5"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Esri Rest API","format":"Esri REST","mediaType":"application/json","accessURL":"https://apps.fs.usda.gov/arcx/rest/services/EDW/EDW_AerialFireRetardantHydrographicAvoidanceAreas_01/MapServer/5"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"GeoJSON","format":"GeoJSON","mediaType":"application/vnd.geo+json","downloadURL":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/839b839dc864470e8d5fc12d883e4546_5.geojson"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"CSV","format":"CSV","mediaType":"text/csv","downloadURL":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/839b839dc864470e8d5fc12d883e4546_5.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"KML","format":"KML","mediaType":"application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml","downloadURL":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/839b839dc864470e8d5fc12d883e4546_5.kml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Shapefile","format":"ZIP","mediaType":"application/zip","downloadURL":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/839b839dc864470e8d5fc12d883e4546_5.zip"}],"landingPage":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/839b839dc864470e8d5fc12d883e4546_5","webService":"https://apps.fs.usda.gov/arcx/rest/services/EDW/EDW_AerialFireRetardantHydrographicAvoidanceAreas_01/MapServer/5","license":"https://hub.arcgis.com/api/v2/datasets/839b839dc864470e8d5fc12d883e4546_5/license","spatial":"-124.4162,41.8829,-116.3927,49.0006","theme":["geospatial"]},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","identifier":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/7ebead065bc8468fb3e48bcce4882d84_10","title":"Existing Vegetation: Region 5 - South Sierra (Feature Layer)","description":"This Existing Vegetation (Eveg) polygon feature class is a CALVEG (Classification and Assessment with LANDSAT of Visible Ecological Groupings) map product from a scale of 1:24,000 to 1:100,000 for CALVEG Zone 4, the South Sierra.

Drinking Water Importance - Forests on the Edge (Feature Layer)","description":"America's private forests provide a vast array of public goods and services, including abundant, clean surface water. Forest loss and development can affect water quality and quantity when forests are removed and impervious surfaces, such as paved roads, spread across the landscape. We rank watersheds across the conterminous United States according to the contributions of private forest land to surface drinking water and by threats to surface water from increased housing density. Private forest land contributions to drinking water are greatest in the East but are also important in Western watersheds. Development pressures on these contributions are concentrated in the Eastern United States but are also found in the North-Central region, parts of the West and Southwest, and the Pacific Northwest; nationwide, more than 55 million acres of rural private forest land are projected to experience a substantial increase in housing density from 2000 to 2030. Planners, communities, and private landowners can use a range of strategies to maintain freshwater ecosystems, including designing housing and roads to minimize impacts on water quality, managing home sites to protect water resources, and using payment schemes and management partnerships to invest in forest stewardship on public and private lands.This data is based on the digital hydrologic unit boundary layer to the Subwatershed (12-digit) 6th level for the continental United States. To focus this analysis on watersheds with private forests, only watersheds with at least 10% forested land and more than 50 acres of private forest were analyzed. All other watersheds were labeled ?Insufficient private forest for this analysis&quot;and coded -99999 in the data table. This dataset updates forest and development statistics reported in the the 2011 Forests to Faucet analysis using 2006 National Land Cover Database for the Conterminous United States, Grid Values=41,42,43,95. and Theobald, Dr. David M. 10 March 2008. bhc2000 and bhc2030 (Housing density for the coterminous US in 2000 and 2030, respectively.)

It contains the Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRA) that were used in the Final Environmental Impact Statement for the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule. The IRA data was originally submitted to the Geospatial Service and Technology Center (GSTC - Located in Salt Lake City Utah) by all national forests through their Regional Offices for the Forest Service?s Roadless Area Conservation Initiative. The data was consolidated at the GSTC and used in the Draft Environment Impact Statement. Between the draft and final stages of the Environmental Impact Statement, the data was updated by the forests to reflect any corrections to Inventoried Roadless Areas that were based on existing forest plans and administrative record. The data was also supplemented to include Special Designated Area information and to include Inventoried Roadless Areas within Special Designated Areas. The data was resubmitted to the GSTC on July 21, 2000 for consolidation and the completed coverage was used in the Roadless Area Conservation Final Environmental Impact Statement. IRAs are based on completed forest plans, forest plans in revision where the agency has established an inventory (this information should be available in Appendix C of most forest plans), or other assessments that are completed and adopted by the agency. RARE II (Roadless Area Review and Evaluation of 1977 and 1978) information was used in cases where a forest does not have a more current roadless inventory, which was established using RARE II

Forests and/or regions have had the opportunity to modify the default NHD water representation (300ft buffer from all water features) for their areas of interest to accurately represent aerial fire retardant avoidance areas as described in the 2011 Record of Decision for the Nationwide Aerial Application of Fire Retardant on National Forest System Land EIS. These changes have been integrated into this dataset depicting aerial fire retardant avoidance areas for hydrographic features. The following process was used to develop the hydrographic areas to be avoided by aerial fire retardant. Initially, all intermittent/ephemeral and perennial features were buffered by 300 feet by the Forest/Region units. Subsequently, Forest/Region units may have extended these buffers locally based on their requirements. There may be overlapping features that have been created during the buffering process, so one must dissolve features before calculating any area values. Data is symbolized by FCODE. Using the FCODE attribute, streams/rivers/waterbodies are categorized into perennial and intermittent/ephemeral types. Avoidance features (streams and rivers) with FCODES 46003 and 46007, as well as features (lakes and other waterbody) with FCODES 39001, 39005, 39006, 43614, 46601 are considered intermittent/ephemeral features. All other FCODES are considered to be perennial features. All underground and covered water features (e.g., pipelines) are excluded. When symbolizing this information, perennial features should be drawn on top of intermittent/ephemeral features to give the proper message. Data displays at scales larger than 1:1,250,000. Data uses a Web Mercator projection. The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee. <a href=\"https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_R08.AFRAA_Hydro.xml\" target=\"_blank\">Metadata</a>","keyword":["Inland Waters","Fire and Aviation","Aerial","Retardant Avoidance","Hydrographic","AFRAA","Open Data"],"issued":"2017-03-27T22:01:50.000Z","modified":"2018-02-05T17:25:06.000Z","publisher":{"name":"U.S. Forest Service"},"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"USFS AGOL Admin","hasEmail":"mailto:ebaiello@fs.fed.us"},"accessLevel":"public","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"ArcGIS Open Dataset","format":"Web page","mediaType":"text/html","accessURL":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/ade068b849e24c02b17273175b1c7ab0_6"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Esri Rest API","format":"Esri REST","mediaType":"application/json","accessURL":"https://apps.fs.usda.gov/arcx/rest/services/EDW/EDW_AerialFireRetardantHydrographicAvoidanceAreas_01/MapServer/6"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"GeoJSON","format":"GeoJSON","mediaType":"application/vnd.geo+json","downloadURL":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/ade068b849e24c02b17273175b1c7ab0_6.geojson"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"CSV","format":"CSV","mediaType":"text/csv","downloadURL":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/ade068b849e24c02b17273175b1c7ab0_6.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"KML","format":"KML","mediaType":"application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml","downloadURL":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/ade068b849e24c02b17273175b1c7ab0_6.kml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Shapefile","format":"ZIP","mediaType":"application/zip","downloadURL":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/ade068b849e24c02b17273175b1c7ab0_6.zip"}],"landingPage":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/ade068b849e24c02b17273175b1c7ab0_6","webService":"https://apps.fs.usda.gov/arcx/rest/services/EDW/EDW_AerialFireRetardantHydrographicAvoidanceAreas_01/MapServer/6","license":"https://hub.arcgis.com/api/v2/datasets/ade068b849e24c02b17273175b1c7ab0_6/license","spatial":"-97.7863,18.2446,-65.7087,39.1327","theme":["geospatial"]},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","identifier":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/0b4c3de263c54f159e26485e8dea4677_4","title":"Rapid Assessment of Vegetation Condition: Fire Perimeter Boundaries (Feature Layer)","description":"The USDA Forest Service Rapid Assessment of Vegetation Condition after Wildfire (RAVG) program produces geospatial data and maps of post-fire vegetation condition using standardized change detection methods based on Landsat or similar multispectral satellite imagery.

Standard thematic products include 7-class percent change in basal area (BA-7), 5-class percent change in canopy cover (CC-5), and 4-class CBI (CBI-4). Contingent upon the availability of suitable imagery, RAVG products are prepared for all wildland fires reported within the conterminous United States (CONUS) that include at least 1000 acres of forested National Forest System (NFS) land (500 acres for Regions 8 and 9 as of 2016). Data for individual fires are typically made available within 45 days after fire containment (&quot;initial assessments&quot;). Late-season fires, however, may be deferred until the following spring or summer (&quot;extended assessments&quot;). National mosaics of each thematic product are prepared annually. This map service includes perimeters for fires that burned during calendar years 2013 through 2016, excluding 2016 extended assessments.

The following core data elements were required for records to be included in this data publication: discovery date, final fire size, and a point location at least as precise as Public Land Survey System (PLSS) section (1-square mile grid). The data were transformed to conform, when possible, to the data standards of the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG). Basic error-checking was performed and redundant records were identified and removed, to the degree possible.

This application complements its companion NRM applications, which cover the spectrum of living and non-living natural resource information. This layer represents Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration (CFLR) Program project activities. Also included are other High Priority Restoration projects that are funded outside of CFLR.

Forests and/or regions have had the opportunity to modify the default NHD water representation (300ft buffer from all water features) for their areas of interest to accurately represent aerial fire retardant avoidance areas as described in the 2011 Record of Decision for the Nationwide Aerial Application of Fire Retardant on National Forest System Land EIS. These changes have been integrated into this dataset depicting aerial fire retardant avoidance areas for hydrographic features. The following process was used to develop the hydrographic areas to be avoided by aerial fire retardant. Initially, all intermittent/ephemeral and perennial features were buffered by 300 feet by the Forest/Region units. Subsequently, Forest/Region units may have extended these buffers locally based on their requirements. There may be overlapping features that have been created during the buffering process, so one must dissolve features before calculating any area values. Data is symbolized by FCODE. Using the FCODE attribute, streams/rivers/waterbodies are categorized into perennial and intermittent/ephemeral types. Avoidance features (streams and rivers) with FCODES 46003 and 46007, as well as features (lakes and other waterbody) with FCODES 39001, 39005, 39006, 43614, 46601 are considered intermittent/ephemeral features. All other FCODES are considered to be perennial features. All underground and covered water features (e.g., pipelines) are excluded. When symbolizing this information, perennial features should be drawn on top of intermittent/ephemeral features to give the proper message. Data displays at scales larger than 1:1,250,000. Data uses a Web Mercator projection. The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist.

This Feature Class shows areas, provided by each National Forest who used aerial fire retardant from 2000-2010, where the aerial application of fire retardant should be avoided in order to prevent the potential of impacts to Federally listed threatened or endangered species as identified through consultation, or Forest Service sensitive species. Data includes location of terrestrial and hydrographic areas where the application of aerial fire retardant is to be avoided. Current aerial fire retardant standards prohibit application within 300 feet of hydrographic features. Therefore, this data may contain duplicate hydrographic areas already covered by existing standards. This data is to be used in planning and implementation phases of USFS fire activities to help prevent misapplication of aerial fire retardant in known areas of TES species or water features throughout National Forest lands. Provided here is a National merged dataset derived from each National Forest contribution. This data has been merged, dissolved, and erased of attributes contained in each original component dataset. For this purpose, specific attributes are not necessary, as any spatial areas depicted simply show areas where aerial fire retardant use is to be avoided as stated in USFS guidelines. <a href=\"https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.AerialFireRetardantAvoidance.xml\" target=\"_blank\">Metadata</a>","keyword":["Fire and Aviation","Aerial","Retardant Avoidance","AFRAA","Terrestrial","Open Data"],"issued":"2017-03-27T22:25:42.000Z","modified":"2018-02-05T17:25:01.000Z","publisher":{"name":"U.S. Forest Service"},"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"USFS AGOL Admin","hasEmail":"mailto:ebaiello@fs.fed.us"},"accessLevel":"public","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"ArcGIS Open Dataset","format":"Web page","mediaType":"text/html","accessURL":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/36450fe86e484542b2efab4518217c58_0"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Esri Rest API","format":"Esri REST","mediaType":"application/json","accessURL":"https://apps.fs.usda.gov/arcx/rest/services/EDW/EDW_AerialFireRetardantAvoidanceAreas_01/MapServer/0"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"GeoJSON","format":"GeoJSON","mediaType":"application/vnd.geo+json","downloadURL":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/36450fe86e484542b2efab4518217c58_0.geojson"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"CSV","format":"CSV","mediaType":"text/csv","downloadURL":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/36450fe86e484542b2efab4518217c58_0.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"KML","format":"KML","mediaType":"application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml","downloadURL":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/36450fe86e484542b2efab4518217c58_0.kml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Shapefile","format":"ZIP","mediaType":"application/zip","downloadURL":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/36450fe86e484542b2efab4518217c58_0.zip"}],"landingPage":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/36450fe86e484542b2efab4518217c58_0","webService":"https://apps.fs.usda.gov/arcx/rest/services/EDW/EDW_AerialFireRetardantAvoidanceAreas_01/MapServer/0","license":"https://hub.arcgis.com/api/v2/datasets/36450fe86e484542b2efab4518217c58_0/license","spatial":"-124.3891,30.3706,-76.7469,49.0012","theme":["geospatial"]},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","identifier":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/fb0371d15136458c85bd7ccf0bc63aa3","title":"Absolute change in winter average temperature (Image Service)","description":"<div><div><div><p>This raster contains absolute change in winter average temperature values.

These changes have been integrated into this dataset depicting aerial fire retardant avoidance areas for hydrographic features. The following process was used to develop the hydrographic areas to be avoided by aerial fire retardant. Initially, all intermittent/ephemeral and perennial features were buffered by 300 feet by the Forest/Region units. Subsequently, Forest/Region units may have extended these buffers locally based on their requirements. There may be overlapping features that have been created during the buffering process, so one must dissolve features before calculating any area values. Data is symbolized by FCODE. Using the FCODE attribute, streams/rivers/waterbodies are categorized into perennial and intermittent/ephemeral types.

Forests and/or regions have had the opportunity to modify the default NHD water representation (300ft buffer from all water features) for their areas of interest to accurately represent aerial fire retardant avoidance areas as described in the 2011 Record of Decision for the Nationwide Aerial Application of Fire Retardant on National Forest System Land EIS. These changes have been integrated into this dataset depicting aerial fire retardant avoidance areas for hydrographic features. The following process was used to develop the hydrographic areas to be avoided by aerial fire retardant. Initially, all intermittent/ephemeral and perennial features were buffered by 300 feet by the Forest/Region units. Subsequently, Forest/Region units may have extended these buffers locally based on their requirements. There may be overlapping features that have been created during the buffering process, so one must dissolve features before calculating any area values. Data is symbolized by FCODE. Using the FCODE attribute, streams/rivers/waterbodies are categorized into perennial and intermittent/ephemeral types. Avoidance features (streams and rivers) with FCODES 46003 and 46007, as well as features (lakes and other waterbody) with FCODES 39001, 39005, 39006, 43614, 46601 are considered intermittent/ephemeral features. All other FCODES are considered to be perennial features. All underground and covered water features (e.g., pipelines) are excluded. When symbolizing this information, perennial features should be drawn on top of intermittent/ephemeral features to give the proper message. Data displays at scales larger than 1:1,250,000. Data uses a Web Mercator projection. The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico.

Recreational rivers are readily accessible by road or railroad, may have some development along their shorelines, and may have been dammed in the past. <a href=\"https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.WildScenicRiverSegment_LN.xml\" target=\"_blank\">Metadata</a>","keyword":["Inland Waters","NPS","BLM","FWS","FS","Wild and Scenic Rivers","NHD","Scenic","Wild","Recreation","River","Hydrography","Open Data"],"issued":"2017-04-14T16:50:41.000Z","modified":"2018-02-05T17:25:00.000Z","publisher":{"name":"U.S. Forest Service"},"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"USFS AGOL Admin","hasEmail":"mailto:ebaiello@fs.fed.us"},"accessLevel":"public","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"ArcGIS Open Dataset","format":"Web page","mediaType":"text/html","accessURL":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/d7a7e66ff68044e4be51fbb76ecf0d0b_1"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Esri Rest API","format":"Esri REST","mediaType":"application/json","accessURL":"https://apps.fs.usda.gov/arcx/rest/services/EDW/EDW_WildScenicRiverSegments_01/MapServer/1"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"GeoJSON","format":"GeoJSON","mediaType":"application/vnd.geo+json","downloadURL":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/d7a7e66ff68044e4be51fbb76ecf0d0b_1.geojson"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"CSV","format":"CSV","mediaType":"text/csv","downloadURL":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/d7a7e66ff68044e4be51fbb76ecf0d0b_1.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"KML","format":"KML","mediaType":"application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml","downloadURL":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/d7a7e66ff68044e4be51fbb76ecf0d0b_1.kml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Shapefile","format":"ZIP","mediaType":"application/zip","downloadURL":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/d7a7e66ff68044e4be51fbb76ecf0d0b_1.zip"}],"landingPage":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/d7a7e66ff68044e4be51fbb76ecf0d0b_1","webService":"https://apps.fs.usda.gov/arcx/rest/services/EDW/EDW_WildScenicRiverSegments_01/MapServer/1","license":"https://hub.arcgis.com/api/v2/datasets/d7a7e66ff68044e4be51fbb76ecf0d0b_1/license","spatial":"-163.3,18.2333,-65.7486,69.0551","theme":["geospatial"]},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","identifier":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/5bd9e75db3f2413c828cc8cd36fa130d_4","title":"Aerial Fire Retardant Hydrographic Avoidance Areas: Aquatic - Region 5 (Feature Layer)","description":"Aerial retardant avoidance area for hydrographic feature data are based on high resolution National Hydrographic Dataset (NHD) produced by USGS and available from the USFS. Forests and/or regions have had the opportunity to modify the default NHD water representation (300ft buffer from all water features) for their areas of interest to accurately represent aerial fire retardant avoidance areas as described in the 2011 Record of Decision for the Nationwide Aerial Application of Fire Retardant on National Forest System Land EIS. These changes have been integrated into this dataset depicting aerial fire retardant avoidance areas for hydrographic features. The following process was used to develop the hydrographic areas to be avoided by aerial fire retardant. Initially, all intermittent/ephemeral and perennial features were buffered by 300 feet by the Forest/Region units. Subsequently, Forest/Region units may have extended these buffers locally based on their requirements. There may be overlapping features that have been created during the buffering process, so one must dissolve features before calculating any area values. Data is symbolized by FCODE. Using the FCODE attribute, streams/rivers/waterbodies are categorized into perennial and intermittent/ephemeral types. Avoidance features (streams and rivers) with FCODES 46003 and 46007, as well as features (lakes and other waterbody) with FCODES 39001, 39005, 39006, 43614, 46601 are considered intermittent/ephemeral features. All other FCODES are considered to be perennial features. All underground and covered water features (e.g., pipelines) are excluded. When symbolizing this information, perennial features should be drawn on top of intermittent/ephemeral features to give the proper message. Data displays at scales larger than 1:1,250,000. Data uses a Web Mercator projection. The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee. <a href=\"https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_R05.AFRAA_Hydro.xml\" target=\"_blank\">Metadata</a>","keyword":["Inland Waters","Fire and Aviation","Aerial","Retardant Avoidance","Hydrographic","AFRAA","Open Data"],"issued":"2017-03-27T22:01:50.000Z","modified":"2018-02-05T17:25:00.000Z","publisher":{"name":"U.S. Forest Service"},"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"USFS AGOL Admin","hasEmail":"mailto:ebaiello@fs.fed.us"},"accessLevel":"public","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"ArcGIS Open Dataset","format":"Web page","mediaType":"text/html","accessURL":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/5bd9e75db3f2413c828cc8cd36fa130d_4"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Esri Rest API","format":"Esri REST","mediaType":"application/json","accessURL":"https://apps.fs.usda.gov/arcx/rest/services/EDW/EDW_AerialFireRetardantHydrographicAvoidanceAreas_01/MapServer/4"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"GeoJSON","format":"GeoJSON","mediaType":"application/vnd.geo+json","downloadURL":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/5bd9e75db3f2413c828cc8cd36fa130d_4.geojson"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"CSV","format":"CSV","mediaType":"text/csv","downloadURL":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/5bd9e75db3f2413c828cc8cd36fa130d_4.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"KML","format":"KML","mediaType":"application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml","downloadURL":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/5bd9e75db3f2413c828cc8cd36fa130d_4.kml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Shapefile","format":"ZIP","mediaType":"application/zip","downloadURL":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/5bd9e75db3f2413c828cc8cd36fa130d_4.zip"}],"landingPage":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/5bd9e75db3f2413c828cc8cd36fa130d_4","webService":"https://apps.fs.usda.gov/arcx/rest/services/EDW/EDW_AerialFireRetardantHydrographicAvoidanceAreas_01/MapServer/4","license":"https://hub.arcgis.com/api/v2/datasets/5bd9e75db3f2413c828cc8cd36fa130d_4/license","spatial":"-124.0917,32.6582,-116.3821,42.0837","theme":["geospatial"]},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","identifier":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/d5b2fc2f05534d16be85122c4b3f0104_3","title":"Ecological Subsections (Feature Layer)","description":"This data set includes polygons for ecological subsections within Subregions within the conterminous United States.

Triennial dormant season treatments were eventually combined. Variables tracked over time include the impact of fire on overstory pine growth, midstory (in this study midstory includes understory plants &gt; 4.5 feet high) structure and composition, seedling (in this study including all woody plants &lt; 4.5 feet high and all other plants regardless of height) species dominance, percent cover, pine seedling establishment and mortality, and forest floor consumption.

Vegetation was measured in nested circular plots and on line transects. Live and dead overstory trees on two 0.2 acre (1/5 ac) subplots per treatment plot were tallied annually by species with diameter at breast height and height, measured and pest damage/mortality by pathogen, lightning and wind damage recorded. Basal area was calculated periodically. Some overstory pines were bored to determine age (typically after death). Midstory live and dead trees were tallied annually on six 0.02 acre subplots per treatment plot. Seedlings were tallied on eighteen 0.001 acre (MA = milacre) subplots per treatment plot by species/species group, and percent of the subplot area in vines, herbs, moss, live woody material, dead plant material, and void of plant material (exposed mineral soil). Six 33 feet line transects per treatment plot were divided into 6 inch segments and dominant seedling species/species group tallied annually. Over 150 species/species groups were identified and tracked over time. Weights of likely available live fuel were determined by species/species group prior to each burn, as were weights of likely available dead fuel for various categories/size classes. Paired postburn samples were collected to determine consumption of various fuel categories. Overstory and midstory pine crown scorch, foliage consumption, and hardwood mortality were tallied within two weeks following each burn. Other vegetation datasets include pine seedling establishment and survival over time on the 18 MA subplots per treatment plot. Red cockaded woodpecker (RCW) related information was collected annually by Region 8 (Southern Region) of the USFS and is available from them. Live and dead fuel moisture data were sampled prior to every burn and can include preburn moisture content grab samples, 10-hour fuel stick readings, and random lumber probe readings. Fire behavior records of headfires and backfires can include rate of spread, flame length, flame angle, flame zone depth, short distance spotting, slopovers, burnout time, and percent of plot burned. The study plan called for observations of fire residence time as well, but such observations were rarely recorded. Weather data include on-plot hand-held instrument observations of surface wind velocity, ambient temperature and relative humidity (RH). On-site data collected can include precipitation, ambient temperature, RH and wind traces from recording gauges. Keetch Byram Drought Index (KBDI) calculation and National Fire danger Rating System NFDRS predictions and other weather observations taken at two nearby Georgia Forestry Commission weather stations were also included.","keyword":["biota","climatologyMeteorologyAtmosphere","Ecology","Ecosystems"," Environment","Plant ecology","Fire","Fire ecology","Prescribed fire","Natural Resource Management  Use","Restoration","Timber","fire reintroduction","fire effects","fire behavior","fire damage","southern pine beetle damage","SPB damage","control of unwanted species","lower GA Piedmont vegetation","low intensity fire","hardwood control","old growth loblolly pine site","Joint Fire Science Program","JFSP","multiple species","plants","Hitchiti Experimental Forest","Brender Demonstration Forest","Oconee Ranger District","Chattahoochee National Forest","Georgia","Jones County","Open Data","RDA"],"issued":"2017-11-22T23:00:58.000Z","modified":"2018-02-05T16:53:59.142Z","publisher":{"name":"U.S. Forest Service"},"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"USFS AGOL Admin","hasEmail":"mailto:ebaiello@fs.fed.us"},"accessLevel":"public","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","format":"Web Page","mediaType":"text/html","accessURL":"https://doi.org/10.2737/RDS-2016-0028"}],"landingPage":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/05e7b05a038041678748b0d66ca7c8ca","webService":"https://doi.org/10.2737/RDS-2016-0028","license":"https://hub.arcgis.com/api/v2/datasets/05e7b05a038041678748b0d66ca7c8ca/license","spatial":"-180.0,-90.0,180.0,90.0"},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","identifier":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/c196f700569747658405eaade2cfb486","title":"Fluorescence emission images of wood stained with acridine orange","description":"Colonization of wood blocks, Picea glauca, by brown and white rot fungi, Postia placenta, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, and Serpula lacrymans, rapidly resulted in detectable wood oxidation, as shown by a reduced phloroglucinol response, a loss of autofluorescence, and acridine orange (AO) staining.

FIA's primary objective is to determine the extent, condition, volume, growth, and depletion of timber on the Nation's forest land. Before 1999, all inventories were conducted on a periodic basis. The passage of the 1998 Farm Bill requires FIA to collect data annually on plots within each State. This kind of up-to-date information is essential to frame realistic forest policies and programs. Summary reports for individual States are published but the Forest Service also provides data collected in each inventory to those interested in further analysis. Data is distributed via the FIA DataMart in a standard format. This standard format, referred to as the Forest Inventory and Analysis Database (FIADB) structure, was developed to provide users with as much data as possible in a consistent manner among States. A number of inventories conducted prior to the implementation of the annual inventory are available in the FIADB. However, various data attributes may be empty or the items may have been collected or computed differently. Annual inventories use a common plot design and common data collection procedures nationwide, resulting in greater consistency among FIA work units than earlier inventories.

Production data were generated from the Rangeland Vegetation Simulator (RVS). This program uses Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from 2000-2015 at 250 square meter resolution to estimate production. NDVI is converted to production estimates using vegetation specific coefficients in the Rangeland Vegetation Simulator (RVS). In addition to annual production data (offered in pounds per acre), this ESRI grid dataset also provides an annual summation of drought data from the USDA drought monitor for aiding interpretation of annual production data. Both the production and drought data are offered from 2000-2015. In addition, basic relationships, such as correlation coefficients, between drought and productivity are offered so that the analyst can find anomalies in allotments where production is not matching temporal patterns of drought. The RVS was applied to allotments of Region 5 of the USFS. The allotment data were spatially combined with CalVeg (Classification and Assessment with Landsat of Visible Ecological Groupings) (a polygon based description of vegetation types for California and more information can be found at: https://www.fs.fed.us/r5/rsl/projects/classification/system.shtml) layer to produce 4035 unique combinations of vegetation attributes and allotments. The vegetation classification used to do this combination was the Society for Range Management (SRM) cover type. There were 23 vegetation types considered to represent non-forested vegetation in the SRM classification found across the grazing allotments. The time period of analysis for this assessment across which production estimates were developed was also 2000-2015.","keyword":["vegetation","rangeland productivity","drought","grazing allotments","NEPA","National Environmental Policy Act","carrying capacity","biota","environment","Natural Resource Management  Use","Range management  grazing","Assessments","Monitoring","Ecosystem services","Region 5","California","Open Data","RDA"],"issued":"2018-01-24T16:25:00.000Z","modified":"2018-02-05T16:53:52.674Z","publisher":{"name":"U.S. Forest Service"},"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"USFS AGOL Admin","hasEmail":"mailto:ebaiello@fs.fed.us"},"accessLevel":"public","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","format":"Web Page","mediaType":"text/html","accessURL":"https://doi.org/10.2737/RDS-2017-0004"}],"landingPage":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/26235d2b8df64dddad6009520653d6a4","webService":"https://doi.org/10.2737/RDS-2017-0004","license":"https://hub.arcgis.com/api/v2/datasets/26235d2b8df64dddad6009520653d6a4/license","spatial":"-180.0,-90.0,180.0,90.0"},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","identifier":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/a7f5500725024340b188066be3ed608d","title":"Data and source code for &quot;A Bayesian model to correct underestimated 3D wind speeds from sonic anemometers increases turbulent components of the surface energy balance&quot;","description":"Sonic anemometers are the principal instruments in micrometeorological studies of turbulence and ecosystem fluxes. Common designs underestimate vertical wind measurements because they lack a correction for transducer shadowing, with no consensus on a suitable correction. We present a subset of data collected during field experiments in 2011 and 2013 featuring two or four CSAT3 sonic anemometers. We introduce a Bayesian analysis to resolve the three-dimensional correction by optimizing differences between anemometers mounted both vertically and horizontally. A grid of 512 points (~ ±5°resolution in wind location) is defined on a sphere around the sonic anemometer, from which the shadow correction for each transducer-pair is derived from a set of 138 unique state variables describing the quadrants and borders. Using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, the Bayesian model proposes new values for each state variable, recalculates the fast-response dataset, summarizes the five-minute wind statistics, and accepts the proposed new values based on the probability that they make measurements from vertical and horizontal anemometers more equivalent. MCMC chains were constructed for three different prior distributions describing the state variables: no shadow correction, the Kaimal correction for transducer shadowing, and double the Kaimal correction, all initialized with 10% uncertainty. This archive includes all data and source code required to create the 3-D posterior correction and to analyze its effect during the 2011 and 2013 field experiments plus a 2016 field validation experiment. There are 20 Hz wind velocity and temperature data from the 2011 and 2013 field experiments contained within 74,664 files (one file each per five-minute period, replicate anemometer, and separated between wind and temperature) and 20 Hz wind velocity and temperature data from the 2016 experiment contained within 1883 files (one file each per each five-minute period, each file contains 3 replicate anemometers). R code is provided to estimate the posterior correction from the 2011 and 2013 wind data using Bayesian analysis assuming three prior corrections: a flat prior, the Kaimal correction, and double the Kaimal correction. Matlab code is provided to normalize, thin, and scale the posterior correction into its final form. Matlab code is provided to apply the posterior correction and to analyze is effect for both sets of data. Auxiliary files to execute the code are also provided.","keyword":["climatologyMeteorologyAtmosphere","Climate change","Carbon","Ecology","Ecosystems"," Environment","Hydrology","watersheds","sedimentation","sonic anemometry","eddy covariance","Glacier Lakes Ecosystem Experiments Site","GLEES","Medicine Bow National Forest","Wyoming","Agricultural Research Development and Education Center","ARDEC","Fort Collins","Colorado","Open Data","RDA"],"issued":"2017-11-24T22:59:15.000Z","modified":"2018-02-05T16:53:52.451Z","publisher":{"name":"U.S. Forest Service"},"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"USFS AGOL Admin","hasEmail":"mailto:ebaiello@fs.fed.us"},"accessLevel":"public","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","format":"Web Page","mediaType":"text/html","accessURL":"https://doi.org/10.2737/RDS-2016-0037"}],"landingPage":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/a7f5500725024340b188066be3ed608d","webService":"https://doi.org/10.2737/RDS-2016-0037","license":"https://hub.arcgis.com/api/v2/datasets/a7f5500725024340b188066be3ed608d/license","spatial":"-180.0,-90.0,180.0,90.0"},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","identifier":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f110376ce18643098da4bc3a121f45ac","title":"Coram Experimental Forest daily meteorology data for Desert Ridge and Terrace Hills weather stations: 1996-2015","description":"This data publication contains daily meteorological data collected at the Desert Ridge and Terrace Hills weather stations located on the Coram Experimental Forest (Flathead National Forest) in Montana.

Because they indicate conditional probabilities (i.e., representing the likelihood of burning at a certain intensity level, given that a fire occurs), the FIL*_20160830 data must be used in conjunction with the BP_20160830 data for risk assessment.","keyword":["burn probability","fire intensity","flame length","Ecology","Ecosystems"," Environment","CONUS","conterminous United States","Fire","geoscientificInformation","Open Data"],"issued":"2017-06-08T21:14:51.000Z","modified":"2018-01-03T23:15:54.000Z","publisher":{"name":"U.S. Forest Service"},"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"USFS AGOL Admin","hasEmail":"mailto:ebaiello@fs.fed.us"},"accessLevel":"public","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","format":"Web Page","mediaType":"text/html","accessURL":"https://apps.fs.usda.gov/arcx/rest/services/RDW_Wildfire/ProbabilisticWildfireRisk/MapServer"}],"landingPage":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/203afc0fea1a411fa2147ba9c5ef6119","webService":"https://apps.fs.usda.gov/arcx/rest/services/RDW_Wildfire/ProbabilisticWildfireRisk/MapServer","license":"https://hub.arcgis.com/api/v2/datasets/203afc0fea1a411fa2147ba9c5ef6119/license","spatial":"-127.738,24.046,-73.949,49.497"},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","identifier":"http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/68a04040ff164bd4a6f13980001caf7c","title":"RxCADRE 2012: In-situ fire behavior measurements","description":"This data publication contains fire behavior package (FBP) data; primarily flame temperature, horizontal and vertical mass flow, fire intensity, as well as ocular rates of spread (ROS), wind speed and direction data from the Prescribed Fire Combustion and Atmospheric Dynamics Research Experiment (RxCADRE) project conducted in November, 2012. These experiments were conducted on 7 small replicate and 3 large operational prescribed burn blocks in longleaf pine ecosystems on Eglin Air Force Base in Okaloosa County, Florida. Data were collected using three separate sensor systems. The first included sensor/datalogger measurements of convective/radiant energy, temperature and mass flow released by the fire. The second was a digital video camera housed in a fire proof enclosure that recorded visual images of the fire behavior. The third was an array of broadly distributed HOBO micro station anemometers. Both FBP sensor packages and camera system were located nominally 0.5 meters above ground level. The anemometers were 3.05 meters above ground level. The raw data have been processed using calibration data and converted into engineering units. The data provides 10 Hz fire flux measurements (kW/m²), temperature (C), and mass flow (m/sec) in the vertical and horizontal direction per FBP.

Species include: Lucy's warbler, southwestern willow flycatcher, western yellow-billed cuckoo, New Mexican meadow jumping mouse, Hispid cotton rat, long-legged bat, Occult bat, Yuma bat, black-necked gartersnake, western painted turtle, american bullfrog, and northern leopard frog. These species were selected because their distribution is tied to a habitat or feature characteristic important to multiple species. Models of suitable habitat for each species are based on observation data from collection and survey samples taken from 1970 through 2013. MaxEnt related species' presence to climate, biophysical, and vegetation characteristics. We then projected future suitability of habitats by applying these models to future conditions as predicted by three climate models at three times periods, 2030 (2020-2060), 2060 (2050-2070), and 2090 (2080-2100). The climate data used in this study were derived from the: 1) Canadian Center for Climate Modeling and analysis (CCC) using the CGCM3.1 model, 2) Geophysical Fluid Dynamics laboratory (GFDL) using the CM2.1 model and, 3) Met office, Hadley Centre (HAD), using the HadCM3 model. The data in this product therefore represent four different time periods for three different models.
