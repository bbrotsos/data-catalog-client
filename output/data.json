The economic types include farming, mining, manufacturing, services, Federal/State government, and unspecialized counties. The policy types include housing stress, low education, low employment, persistent poverty, population loss, nonmetro recreation, and retirement destination. In addition, a code identifying counties with persistent child poverty is available.\r\n\r\nAn update of the County Typology codes is planned for 2014.",

      "description": "The creative class thesis—that towns need to attract engineers, architects, artists, and people in other creative occupations to compete in today's economy—may be particularly relevant to rural communities, which tend to lose much of their talent when young adults leave. The ERS creative class codes indicate a county's share of population employed in occupations that require \"thinking creatively.\" Variables used to construct the ERS creative class measure include number and percent employed in creative class occupations and a metro/nonmetro indicator for all counties, 1990, 2000, and 2007-11. A break-out of employment in the arts is included.",

This series annually measures total U.S. food expenditures, including purchases by consumers, governments, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. Because the term expenditure is often associated with household decisionmaking, it is important to recognize that ERS's series also includes nonhousehold purchases. For example, the series includes the dollar value of domestic food purchases by military personnel and their dependents at military commissary stores and exchanges, the value of commodities and food dollars donated by the Federal government to schools, and the value of food purchased by airlines for serving during flights.",

The aim is not to provide a single definition. Instead, it is to meet the demand for a delineation that is both geographically detailed and adjustable within reasonable ranges, in order to be usefully applied in diverse research and policy contexts. This initial set, based on urban-rural data from the 2000 decennial census, provides four separate FAR definition levels, ranging from one that is relatively inclusive (18 million FAR residents) to one that is more restrictive (4.8 million FAR residents).",

The series was started in 1945, and has since been published about every 5 years, coinciding with the Census of Agriculture. See the latest report in the series, Major Uses of Land in the United States, 2007.\r\n \r\nData from all 14 Major Land Uses reports have been combined into a set of files showing major land use estimates by region and State from 1945 to 2007. Alaska and Hawaii were added in 1959, when they achieved Statehood. Since Alaska contains such vast acreage, 50-State totals in all categories prior to 1959 may appear to change precipitously.",

To provide information useful for projections of future changes in land use, ERS has created a system to classify remaining farmland into \"population-interaction zones for agriculture\" (PIZA). These zones represent areas of agricultural land use in which urban-related activities (residential, commercial, and industrial) affect the economic and social environment of agriculture. In these zones, interactions between urban-related population and farm production activities tend to increase the value of farmland, change the production practices and enterprises of farm operators, and elevate the probability that farmland will be converted to urban-related uses.",

The ERS Rural Definitions data product allows users to make comparisons among nine representative rural definitions. \r\n\r\nMethods of designating the urban periphery range from the use of municipal boundaries to definitions based on counties. Definitions based on municipal boundaries may classify as rural much of what would typically be considered suburban. Definitions that delineate the urban periphery based on counties may include extensive segments of a county that many would consider rural.\r\n\r\nWe have selected a representative set of nine alternative rural definitions and compare social and economic indicators from the 2000 decennial census across the nine definitions. We chose socioeconomic indicators (population, education, poverty, etc.) that are commonly used to highlight differences between urban and rural areas.",

The classification contains two levels. Whole numbers (1-10) delineate metropolitan, micropolitan, small town, and rural commuting areas based on the size and direction of the primary (largest) commuting flows. These 10 codes are further subdivided to permit stricter or looser delimitation of commuting areas, based on secondary (second largest) commuting flows. The approach errs in the direction of more codes, providing flexibility in combining levels to meet varying definitional needs and preferences.\r\n \r\nThe 1990 codes are similarly defined. However, the Census Bureau's methods of defining urban cores and clusters changed between the two censuses. And, census tracts changed in number and shapes. The 2000 rural-urban commuting codes are not directly comparable with the 1990 codes because of these differences.\r\n \r\nAn update of the Rural-Urban Commuting Area Codes is planned for late 2013.",

The Rural-Urban Continuum Codes were originally developed in 1974. They have been updated each decennial since (1983, 1993, 2003, 2013), and slightly revised in 1988. Note that the 2013 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes are not directly comparable with the codes prior to 2000 because of the new methodology used in developing the 2000 metropolitan areas.

Seasonal and climatic factors drive U.S. imports of popular types of fruits and vegetables and tropical products, such as cocoa and coffee. In addition, a growing share of U.S. imports can be attributed to intra-industry trade, whereby agricultural-processing industries based in the United States carry out certain processing steps offshore and import products at different levels of processing from their subsidiaries in foreign markets.\r\n \r\nThis data set provides import values of edible products (food and beverages) entering U.S. ports and their origin of shipment. Data are from the U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Census Bureau.

      "description": "The Dietary Supplement Ingredient Database (DSID) is a collaborative venture with the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements, the US Department of Agriculture and other federal agencies to provide analytically-derived estimates of ingredients in dietary supplements. Release 2 of the DSID reports national estimates for vitamins and minerals in adult and children's multivitamins (MVMs) ( http://dsid.usda.nih.gov).  For the DSID studies, representative supplement products are identified, sampled and analyzed by experienced laboratories. In order to obtain accurate results, a quality assurance and quality control plan are established for each study, with standard reference materials, in-house control materials and product duplicate results assessed before product data are accepted as final.  Laboratory data are then statistically evaluated by ingredient and weighted by market share information, if available. For the MVM studies released in DSID-2, data are reported by ingredient across a range of labeled levels.  Results are predicted by regression and estimate mean percent differences from label and standard errors at these labeled levels. These data can be used by researchers to more accurately quantify nutrient intake from dietary supplements.",

LIS stores datasets from numerous legumes through species-specific webpages, and uses the reference species Glycine max, Lotus japonicus, and Medicago truncatula as a basis for comparisons between and among diverse legume species. Other genomes are being added as they become available. For other legume species, LIS hosts transcriptome assemblies (both traditional EST and NGS-based) and other datasets. Comparative maps, reference datasets, sequence search tools, etc. make these datasets available for exploration and discovery. New features in 2013 include powerful new sequence-search methods and interfaces; new genome browsers for chickpea, common bean, and pigeonpea; inferred syntenic relationships between all sequenced legume genomes; and a new database of trait and QTL data for bean and peanut. LIS is funded by the USDA-ARS, and is developed and maintained jointly by the National Center for Genome Resources (NCGR) and the USDA-ARS at Ames, Iowa.",

      "description": "The statistical data generated through the administration of the Federal milk order program is recognized widely as one of the benefits of this program. These data provide comprehensive and accurate information on milk supplies, utilization, and sales, as well as class prices established under the orders and prices paid to dairy farmers (producers). The sources of this data are monthly reports of receipts and utilization, producer payroll reports, and reports of nonpool handlers filed by milk processors (handlers) subject to the provisions of the various milk orders. The local market administrator (MA) uses these reports to determine pool obligations under the order and to verify proper payments to producers. Auditors employed by the MA review handler records to assure the accuracy of reported information. Reporting errors are corrected; if necessary, pool obligations are revised.\r\n\r\nAfter the pool obligations have been determined the local market administrator summarizes the individual handler reports and submits a series of order summary reports to the Market Information Branch (MIB) in Dairy Programs. The MIB summarizes the individual order data and disseminates this information via monthly, bimonthly, and annual releases or publications. Since milk marketing order statistics are based on reports filed by the population of possible reporting firms and not a sample, these statistics are comprehensive. Also, since these individual firm reports are subject to audit and verification, these statistics are accurate.\r\n\r\nThe Federal milk order statistics database contains historical information, beginning in January 2000, generated by the administration of the Federal milk order program. Most of the information in the database has been published previously by the Market Information Branch in Dairy Programs either on its web site or in the Dairy Market News Report. New users are encouraged to use the \"User Guide\" to learn how to navigate the search screens.  If you are interested in a description of the Federal milk order statistics program, or want current data, in ready made table form, use the \"Current Information\" link.",

The PACA protects businesses dealing in fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables by establishing and enforcing a code of fair business practices and by helping companies resolve business disputes.\r\n \r\nThe PACA Branch is responsible for administering the PACA and offers many services to the industry. PACA Branch experts receive hundreds of telephone calls each week from companies requesting assistance on problems unique to the industry such as interpretation of inspection certificates, advice on contract disputes, and bankruptcy payments.\r\n\r\nThe PACA Search Engine is an online tool that allows the public to determine if a business is licensed under the PACA, users can also see companies trade name(s), branch location(s), principal(s), and other related license information.",

LFP provides compensation to eligible livestock producers who have suffered grazing losses due to drought or fire. LFP payments for drought are equal to 60 percent of the monthly feed cost for up to five months. LFP payments for fire on federally managed rangeland are equal to 50 percent of the monthly feed cost for the number of days the producer is prohibited from grazing the managed rangeland, not to exceed 180 calendar days. The grazing losses must have occurred on or after Oct. 1, 2011. Sign-up will begin on or before April 15, 2014, at any local Farm Service Agency (FSA) service center. Additional details on the types of information required for an application will be provided as part of the sign-up announcement. Some eligibility restrictions may apply.

The tabular data represent the soil attributes, and are derived from properties and characteristics stored in the National Soil Information System (NASIS).

The gridded map layer is offered in an ArcGIS file geodatabase raster format. \r\n\r\nThe raster and vector map data have a Conterminous US-wide extent. The raster map data have a 10 meter cell size that approximates the vector polygons in an Albers Equal Area projection.

A unique map unit key is used to link to raster cells and polygons to attribute tables, including the new value added look up (valu) table that contains additional derived data.\r\n\r\nThe value added look up (valu) table contains attribute data summarized to the map unit level using best practice generalization methods intended to meet the needs of most users.

      "description": "The United States, Caribbean and Pacific Basin Major Land Resource Areas (MLRA) Geographic Database serves as the geospatial expression of the map products presented and described in Agricultural Handbook 296 (2006).  Land resource categories historically used at State and national levels are land resource units, land resource areas, and land resource regions. Land resource units (LRUs) are the basic units from which major land resource areas (MLRAs) are determined.  They are also the basic units for State land resource maps.  LRUs are typically coextensive with State general soil map units, but some general soil map units are subdivided into LRUs because of significant geographic differences in soils, climate, water resources, or land use.  LRUs generally are several thousand acres in size.  A unit can be one continuous area or several separate areas that are near each other.  In 2005, these areas were designated as common resource areas (CRAs) within the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).  CRAs are created by subdividing MLRAs by topography, other landscape features, hydrologic units, resource concerns, resource uses, and human considerations affecting use and soil and water conservation treatment needs.  Common resource areas, or land resource units, are not described in this handbook and are not shown on the national map.  Major land resource areas are geographically associated land resource units.  Land resource regions are a group of geographically associated major land resource areas. Identification of these large areas is important in statewide agricultural planning and has value in interstate, regional, and national planning.  In order to make this handbook more useful to other Federal agencies and private parties using ecological regions for planning or evaluation of natural resources programs and policies, Appendix I (Agriculture Handbook 296, 2006) cross-references MLRAs with Environmental Protection Agency Level III Ecoregions (USEPA, 2003; Omernik, 1987) and U.S. Forest Service ecological sections (Cleland and others, 2005; McNab and others, 2005).  In this handbook, major land resource areas are generally designated by Arabic numbers and identified by a descriptive geographic name.  Examples are MLRA 1 (Northern Pacific Coast Range, Foothills, and Valleys); MLRA 154 (South-Central Florida Ridge); and MLRA 230 (Yukon-Kuskokwim Highlands).  Some MLRAs are designated by an Arabic number and a letter because previously established MLRAs have been divided into smaller, more homogeneous areas, for example, MLRAs 102A, 102B, and 102C.  The use of numbers and letters to identify the newly created MLRAs requires fewer changes in existing information in records and in databases.  A few MLRAs consist of two or more parts separated for short distances by other land resource areas.  In places one of these parts is widely separated from the main body of the MLRA and is in an adjoining LRR.  The description of the respective MLRA also applies to these outlying parts.",

SSURGO is generally the most detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) in accordance with NCSS mapping standards. The tabular data represent the soil attributes, and are derived from properties and characteristics stored in the National Soil Information System (NASIS). \r\n\r\nThe gSSURGO data were prepared by merging traditional SSURGO digital vector map and tabular data into State-wide extents.  A gridded map layer, derived from the vector, at a 10 meter cell size that approximates the vector polygons has been added.  The raster and vector map data are also available in a Conterminous US-wide extent.  The raster map data are in 10-, 30-, and 90- meter cell sizes.  The gridded map layer is offered in an ArcGIS file geodatabase raster format in an Albers Equal Area projection.\r\n\r\nEach cell (and polygon) is linked to a map unit identifier called the map unit key. A unique map unit key is used to link to raster cells and polygons to attribute tables, including the new value added look up (valu) table containing \"ready to map\" attributes and additional derived data.\r\n\r\nThe value added look up (valu) table contains attribute data summarized to the map unit level using best practice generalization methods intended to meet the needs of most users.  The generalization methods include map unit component weighted averages and percent of the map unit meeting a given criteria.",

Sites are identified by unique site identifiers, though a site may be revisited over time producing more than one data set per site.  A particular site will have one or more pedons or soil profiles with one or more soil horizons defined.  Each horizon may have one or more soil samples that have been analyzed at a National Cooperative Soil Survey laboratory to produce measured and calculated values of soil properties, such as bulk density, particle size distribution, and pH.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is a digital soil survey and generally is the most detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was prepared by digitizing maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely sensed and other information. This dataset consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System (NASIS) relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.",

      "description": "This dataset is a digital soil survey and generally is the most detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was prepared by digitizing maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely sensed and other information.\r\n\r\nThis dataset consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.\r\n\r\nSSURGO depicts information about the kinds and distribution of soils on the landscape. The soil map and data used in the SSURGO product were prepared by soil scientists as part of the National Cooperative Soil Survey.",

The objectives of this study were to: Assess how food security and food expenditures vary with SNAP participation. Examine how relationships between SNAP and food security and between SNAP and food expenditures vary by household characteristics and circumstances. Estimating the effect of SNAP on food insecurity using household survey data is challenging because households that choose to participate in SNAP can differ in systematic ways from households that do not participate, making it hard to distinguish the impact of SNAP from these other factors. This study sought to control for the SNAP participation “selection bias” by comparing information collected from households within days of entering the program (new entrants) to information obtained after about 6 months of participation.",

Direct certification is a process conducted by the States and by local educational agencies (LEAs) to certify eligible children for free meals without the need for household applications. States and LEAs directly certified 12.3 million children at the start of SY 2012-2013, an increase of 740,000, or 6 percent, from the previous school year. Over the same period, the population of school-age SNAP participant children increased by just 1.5 percent. As a result, the share of SNAP participant children certified for free school meals without application increased to 89 percent in SY 2012-2013, up from 86 percent in SY 2011-2012.",

In addition to cost, differences among plans are in specific foods and quantities of foods. Another basis of the Food Plans is that all meals and snacks are prepared at home. For specific foods and quantities of foods in the Food Plans, see Thrifty Food Plan, 2006 (2007) and The Low-Cost, Moderate-Cost, and Liberal Food Plans, 2007 (2007).

      "description": "This layer contains features of aerial fire retardant avoidance areas delivered as part of the 2011 Nationwide Aerial Application of Fire Retardant on National Forest System Land Environmental Impact Statement. This Feature Class shows areas, provided by each National Forest who used aerial fire retardant from 2000-2010, where the aerial application of fire retardant should be avoided in order to prevent the potential of impacts to Federally listed threatened or endangered species as identified through consultation, or Forest Service sensitive species. Data includes location of terrestrial and hydrographic areas where the application of aerial fire retardant is to be avoided. Current aerial fire retardant standards prohibit application within 300 feet of hydrographic features. Therefore, this data may contain duplicate hydrographic areas already covered by existing standards. This data is to be used in planning and implementation phases of USFS fire activities to help prevent misapplication of aerial fire retardant in known areas of TES species or water features throughout National Forest lands. Provided here is a National merged dataset derived from each National Forest contribution. This data has been merged, dissolved, and erased of attributes contained in each original component dataset. For this purpose, specific attributes are not necessary, as any spatial areas depicted simply show areas where aerial fire retardant use is to be avoided as stated in USFS guidelines. <a href=\"https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.AerialFireRetardantAvoidance.xml\" target=\"_blank\">Metadata</a>",

      "description": "Aerial retardant avoidance area for hydrographic feature data are based on high resolution National Hydrographic Dataset (NHD) produced by USGS and available from the USFS. Forests and/or regions have had the opportunity to modify the default NHD water representation (300ft buffer from all water features) for their areas of interest to accurately represent aerial fire retardant avoidance areas as described in the 2011 Record of Decision for the Nationwide Aerial Application of Fire Retardant on National Forest System Land EIS. These changes have been integrated into this dataset depicting aerial fire retardant avoidance areas for hydrographic features. The following process was used to develop the hydrographic areas to be avoided by aerial fire retardant. Initially, all intermittent/ephemeral and perennial features were buffered by 300 feet by the Forest/Region units. Subsequently, Forest/Region units may have extended these buffers locally based on their requirements. There may be overlapping features that have been created during the buffering process, so one must dissolve features before calculating any area values. Data is symbolized by FCODE. Using the FCODE attribute, streams/rivers/waterbodies are categorized into perennial and intermittent/ephemeral types. Avoidance features (streams and rivers) with FCODES 46003 and 46007, as well as features (lakes and other waterbody) with FCODES 39001, 39005, 39006, 43614, 46601 are considered intermittent/ephemeral features. All other FCODES are considered to be perennial features. All underground and covered water features (e.g., pipelines) are excluded. When symbolizing this information, perennial features should be drawn on top of intermittent/ephemeral features to give the proper message. Data displays at scales larger than 1:1,250,000. Data uses a Web Mercator projection. The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee. <a href=\"https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_R01.AFRAA_Hydro.xml\" target=\"_blank\">Metadata</a>",

      "description": "Aerial retardant avoidance area for hydrographic feature data are based on high resolution National Hydrographic Dataset (NHD) produced by USGS and available from the USFS. Forests and/or regions have had the opportunity to modify the default NHD water representation (300ft buffer from all water features) for their areas of interest to accurately represent aerial fire retardant avoidance areas as described in the 2011 Record of Decision for the Nationwide Aerial Application of Fire Retardant on National Forest System Land EIS. These changes have been integrated into this dataset depicting aerial fire retardant avoidance areas for hydrographic features. The following process was used to develop the hydrographic areas to be avoided by aerial fire retardant. Initially, all intermittent/ephemeral and perennial features were buffered by 300 feet by the Forest/Region units. Subsequently, Forest/Region units may have extended these buffers locally based on their requirements. There may be overlapping features that have been created during the buffering process, so one must dissolve features before calculating any area values. Data is symbolized by FCODE. Using the FCODE attribute, streams/rivers/waterbodies are categorized into perennial and intermittent/ephemeral types. Avoidance features (streams and rivers) with FCODES 46003 and 46007, as well as features (lakes and other waterbody) with FCODES 39001, 39005, 39006, 43614, 46601 are considered intermittent/ephemeral features. All other FCODES are considered to be perennial features. All underground and covered water features (e.g., pipelines) are excluded. When symbolizing this information, perennial features should be drawn on top of intermittent/ephemeral features to give the proper message. Data displays at scales larger than 1:1,250,000. Data uses a Web Mercator projection. The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee. <a href=\"https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_R02.AFRAA_Hydro.xml\" target=\"_blank\">Metadata</a>",

      "description": "Aerial retardant avoidance area for hydrographic feature data are based on high resolution National Hydrographic Dataset (NHD) produced by USGS and available from the USFS. Forests and/or regions have had the opportunity to modify the default NHD water representation (300ft buffer from all water features) for their areas of interest to accurately represent aerial fire retardant avoidance areas as described in the 2011 Record of Decision for the Nationwide Aerial Application of Fire Retardant on National Forest System Land EIS. These changes have been integrated into this dataset depicting aerial fire retardant avoidance areas for hydrographic features. The following process was used to develop the hydrographic areas to be avoided by aerial fire retardant. Initially, all intermittent/ephemeral and perennial features were buffered by 300 feet by the Forest/Region units. Subsequently, Forest/Region units may have extended these buffers locally based on their requirements. There may be overlapping features that have been created during the buffering process, so one must dissolve features before calculating any area values. Data is symbolized by FCODE. Using the FCODE attribute, streams/rivers/waterbodies are categorized into perennial and intermittent/ephemeral types. Avoidance features (streams and rivers) with FCODES 46003 and 46007, as well as features (lakes and other waterbody) with FCODES 39001, 39005, 39006, 43614, 46601 are considered intermittent/ephemeral features. All other FCODES are considered to be perennial features. All underground and covered water features (e.g., pipelines) are excluded. When symbolizing this information, perennial features should be drawn on top of intermittent/ephemeral features to give the proper message. Data displays at scales larger than 1:1,250,000. Data uses a Web Mercator projection. The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee. <a href=\"https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_R05.AFRAA_Hydro.xml\" target=\"_blank\">Metadata</a>",

      "description": "Aerial retardant avoidance area for hydrographic feature data are based on high resolution National Hydrographic Dataset (NHD) produced by USGS and available from the USFS. Forests and/or regions have had the opportunity to modify the default NHD water representation (300ft buffer from all water features) for their areas of interest to accurately represent aerial fire retardant avoidance areas as described in the 2011 Record of Decision for the Nationwide Aerial Application of Fire Retardant on National Forest System Land EIS. These changes have been integrated into this dataset depicting aerial fire retardant avoidance areas for hydrographic features. The following process was used to develop the hydrographic areas to be avoided by aerial fire retardant. Initially, all intermittent/ephemeral and perennial features were buffered by 300 feet by the Forest/Region units. Subsequently, Forest/Region units may have extended these buffers locally based on their requirements. There may be overlapping features that have been created during the buffering process, so one must dissolve features before calculating any area values. Data is symbolized by FCODE. Using the FCODE attribute, streams/rivers/waterbodies are categorized into perennial and intermittent/ephemeral types. Avoidance features (streams and rivers) with FCODES 46003 and 46007, as well as features (lakes and other waterbody) with FCODES 39001, 39005, 39006, 43614, 46601 are considered intermittent/ephemeral features. All other FCODES are considered to be perennial features. All underground and covered water features (e.g., pipelines) are excluded. When symbolizing this information, perennial features should be drawn on top of intermittent/ephemeral features to give the proper message. Data displays at scales larger than 1:1,250,000. Data uses a Web Mercator projection. The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee. <a href=\"https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_R09.AFRAA_Hydro.xml\" target=\"_blank\">Metadata</a>",

These aerial counts were performed in the fall of each year from 1987 (Nicolet side of CNNF) or 1997 (Chequamegon side of CNNF). Based on the colony counts, we also provide derived beaver colony density values. The surveyed streams were classified into four categories: managed trout, non-managed trout, managed non-trout, and non-managed non-trout. Trout versus non-trout status was assigned by the CNNF using Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources information. Managed streams were those on which targeted removal of beavers was conducted in the spring of each year under a contract with USDA-Wildlife Services. Data also include proportion of stream-side aspen, temperature, snowfall, and soil moisture as measured by the Palmer Drought Severity Index.",

Activities are self-reported by Forest Service Units. The Brush Disposal Program (BD) objective of the BD Program was established in 1916. It requires all purchasers of National Forest timber make deposits to the United States for the estimated cost of disposing of brush and other debris resulting from its cutting operations.

Also included are fire characteristics data from a companion study of fire behavior in similar individual 4-year old live chamise shrubs. The fire behavior data include shrub bulk density, moisture content and total mass consumed during each experimental run for multiple bulk density classes, wind speeds, and ignition methods. Burn time, horizontal and vertical flame spread rates, flame length and flame angle, as well as maximum mass loss rate and peak gas temperatures were also recorded. The R code used to analyze these fire characteristics in Li et al. 2016 is also included.",

In August (Terrace Hills) and September (Desert Ridge) of 2015 the meteorological sensors, new data loggers were installed and the program updated to collect data on an hourly basis. We are more confident in the new data (not yet published) than the data included in this publication because the old sensors were not maintained as recommended by the manufacturer - as detailed in the accuracy report.",

BC emissions were estimated using land cover maps and detected burned areas based on MODIS (MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) remote sensing products, the Forest Inventory Survey of the Russian Federation, the IPCC Tier-1 Global Biomass Carbon Map for the year 2000, and cover type specific BC emission factors. The data publication includes land cover type, fuel loading, and fuel consumption which are input for the model used to estimate BC emissions. These data provide daily emission sources for the assessment of the transport and deposition of BC on Arctic ice and snow.",

      "description": "Sonic anemometers are the principal instruments in micrometeorological studies of turbulence and ecosystem fluxes. Common designs underestimate vertical wind measurements because they lack a correction for transducer shadowing, with no consensus on a suitable correction. We present a subset of data collected during field experiments in 2011 and 2013 featuring two or four CSAT3 sonic anemometers. We introduce a Bayesian analysis to resolve the three-dimensional correction by optimizing differences between anemometers mounted both vertically and horizontally. A grid of 512 points (~ ±5°resolution in wind location) is defined on a sphere around the sonic anemometer, from which the shadow correction for each transducer-pair is derived from a set of 138 unique state variables describing the quadrants and borders. Using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, the Bayesian model proposes new values for each state variable, recalculates the fast-response dataset, summarizes the five-minute wind statistics, and accepts the proposed new values based on the probability that they make measurements from vertical and horizontal anemometers more equivalent. MCMC chains were constructed for three different prior distributions describing the state variables: no shadow correction, the Kaimal correction for transducer shadowing, and double the Kaimal correction, all initialized with 10% uncertainty. This archive includes all data and source code required to create the 3-D posterior correction and to analyze its effect during the 2011 and 2013 field experiments plus a 2016 field validation experiment. There are 20 Hz wind velocity and temperature data from the 2011 and 2013 field experiments contained within 74,664 files (one file each per five-minute period, replicate anemometer, and separated between wind and temperature) and 20 Hz wind velocity and temperature data from the 2016 experiment contained within 1883 files (one file each per each five-minute period, each file contains 3 replicate anemometers). R code is provided to estimate the posterior correction from the 2011 and 2013 wind data using Bayesian analysis assuming three prior corrections: a flat prior, the Kaimal correction, and double the Kaimal correction. Matlab code is provided to normalize, thin, and scale the posterior correction into its final form. Matlab code is provided to apply the posterior correction and to analyze is effect for both sets of data. Auxiliary files to execute the code are also provided.",

A statistical model for each month was parameterized with an integrated moisture index, a cumulative drought severity index for the month during the period 2000 to 2009, percent forest cover, and wildland-urban interface classifications to predict the probability of wildfire occurrence based on reported wildfires. Each model included 10 iterations and the raster products of average, minimum, maximum, median, and standard deviation of the predicted probability of a wildfire occurrence is provided. All raster values were converted to integers by multiplying by 10 to reduce file sizes. Therefore, the range of probabilities is 0 to 1000 for the modeled occurrence of a wildfire.",

      "description": "Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt 3.3.3) methods were used to estimate expected change in suitable habitat for 12 different wildlife species under changing climate along the Rio Grande in New Mexico. Species include: Lucy's warbler, southwestern willow flycatcher, western yellow-billed cuckoo, New Mexican meadow jumping mouse, Hispid cotton rat, long-legged bat, Occult bat, Yuma bat, black-necked gartersnake, western painted turtle, american bullfrog, and northern leopard frog. These species were selected because their distribution is tied to a habitat or feature characteristic important to multiple species. Models of suitable habitat for each species are based on observation data from collection and survey samples taken from 1970 through 2013. MaxEnt related species' presence to climate, biophysical, and vegetation characteristics. We then projected future suitability of habitats by applying these models to future conditions as predicted by three climate models at three times periods, 2030 (2020-2060), 2060 (2050-2070), and 2090 (2080-2100). The climate data used in this study were derived from the: 1) Canadian Center for Climate Modeling and analysis (CCC) using the CGCM3.1 model, 2) Geophysical Fluid Dynamics laboratory (GFDL) using the CM2.1 model and, 3) Met office, Hadley Centre (HAD), using the HadCM3 model. The data in this product therefore represent four different time periods for three different models. Also included are consensus images designating where 1) all three climate models predicted suitable habitat, and 2) at least 2 models predicted suitable habitat.",

      "description": "Hybrid poplars have demonstrated high biomass productivity in the North Central USA as short rotation woody crops (SRWCs). However, our ability to quantitatively predict productivity for sites that are not currently in SRWCs is limited. In this study, the Physiological Processes Predicting Growth (3-PG) model was (1) assigned parameters for hybrid poplars using species-specific physiological data and allometric relationships from previously published studies, (2) calibrated for the North Central region using previously-published biomass data from eight plantations along with site-specific climate and soils data, (3) validated against previously published biomass data from four other plantations using linear regression of actual versus predicted total aboveground dry biomass, (4) evaluated for sensitivity of the model to manipulation of the parameter for age at full canopy cover (fullCanAge) and the fertility rating growth modifier, and (5) combined with soil and climate data layers to produce a map of predicted biomass productivity for the states of Minnesota and Wisconsin. This package contains the polygon feature layer and tabular data that correspond to 'Using a process-based model (3-PG) to predict and map hybrid poplar biomass productivity in Minnesota and Wisconsin, USA.' (Headlee et al. 2013). The tabular data for mean annual biomass for hybrid poplar including the STATSGO soil and NARR climate values were used to generate the biomass values. The WTAvg_DM values represent the overall predicted biomass productivity for hybrid poplars.",

      "description": "Short rotation woody crops such as Populus spp. and their hybrids (i.e., poplars) are a significant component of the total biofuels and bioenergy feedstock resource in the USA. We used available social (i.e., land ownership and cover) and biophysical (i.e., climate and soil characteristics) spatial data to map eligible lands suitable for establishing and growing poplar biomass for bioenergy crops across Minnesota and Wisconsin, USA. This package contains a polygon feature layer and tabular data produced for the 'An approach for siting poplar energy production systems to increase productivity and associated ecosystem services' (Zalesny et al. 2012). The polygon feature layer represents a coarse resolution (approximately 32-kilometer) polygon lattice framework. The associated tabular data includes the mean annual biomass for poplar as well as the SSURGO soil and NARR climate values that were used to generate the biomass values. The WTD_Avg_DM values represent the poplar productivity generated by the Physiological Processes Predicting Growth (3-PG) model. The additional ERDAS IMAGINE raster image contains the final spatial predictions of biomass productivity for hybrid poplar at a finer scale (30-meter resolution).",

      "description": "Fire occurrence database 4th edition represents occurrence of wildfires in the United States from 1992 to 2015. This is the third update of a publication originally generated to support the national Fire Program Analysis (FPA) system. The wildfire records were acquired from the reporting systems of federal, state, and local fire organizations. The following core data elements were required for records to be included in this data publication: discovery date, final fire size, and a point location at least as precise as Public Land Survey System (PLSS) section (1-square mile grid). The data were transformed to conform, when possible, to the data standards of the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG). Basic error-checking was performed and redundant records were identified and removed, to the degree possible. The resulting product, referred to as the Fire Program Analysis fire-occurrence database (FPA FOD), includes 1.88 million geo-referenced wildfire records, representing a total of 140 million acres burned during the 24-year period. <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/products/RDS-2013-0009.4/_metadata_RDS-2013-0009.4.html\" target=\"_blank\">Metadata</a>",

We provide a separate file for each of the 56 Bailey's ecosections (Bailey 2016) across the West, with annual area burned and 112 climate predictor variables such as evapotranspiration, precipitation, relative humidity, soil moisture, snow-water equivalent, minimum and maximum temperature, and vapor pressure deficit.

The data included in this archive were used to refine a method for detecting changes in the chemical properties of wood. This method involves staining the sample with acridine orange and then observing the light emission using a fluorescence microscope. Data include fluorescence emission microscopic images of AO-stained wood, transmission microscopic images of phloroglucinol-stained wood, isothermal titration calorimetry results, and fluorescence emission spectra.",

      "description": "The Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) research program has been in existence since mandated by Congress in 1928. FIA's primary objective is to determine the extent, condition, volume, growth, and depletion of timber on the Nation's forest land. Before 1999, all inventories were conducted on a periodic basis. The passage of the 1998 Farm Bill requires FIA to collect data annually on plots within each State. This kind of up-to-date information is essential to frame realistic forest policies and programs. Summary reports for individual States are published but the Forest Service also provides data collected in each inventory to those interested in further analysis. Data is distributed via the FIA DataMart in a standard format. This standard format, referred to as the Forest Inventory and Analysis Database (FIADB) structure, was developed to provide users with as much data as possible in a consistent manner among States. A number of inventories conducted prior to the implementation of the annual inventory are available in the FIADB. However, various data attributes may be empty or the items may have been collected or computed differently. Annual inventories use a common plot design and common data collection procedures nationwide, resulting in greater consistency among FIA work units than earlier inventories. Links to field collection manuals and the FIADB user's manual are provided in the FIA DataMart.",

Designated areas were selected based on a set of eligibility criteria regarding forest health and do not include any areas coinciding with Wilderness and Wilderness Study Areas. The data is comprised of selected HUC-6 units or other areas of similar size and scope clipped to Proclaimed National Forest System lands. Non-Forest Service land ownership areas (inholdings) are also removed. In some cases, entire National Forests were designated. Some state designations' methodologies may differ from the national standard.Please note that this data is current as of January 15, 2016, and changes to designated areas will be republished and archived on weekly basis. Therefore, the most current layer along with previous years' data are available, and the user should ensure that they understand which layer is being accessed.

Since its creation millions of acres of National Forest System lands (NFS) have been treated and restored to resilient conditions and terrestrial and aquatic habitat improved. Public Law 109-54 of August 2, 2005, Title IV �General Provisions, Sec 412 further amended the K-V Act to allow the collection and use of CWKV funds for watershed restoration, wildlife habitat improvement, to prepare timber sales, control of insects, disease, and noxious weeds, fire community protection activities, and the maintenance of forest roads within the Forest Service region in which the timber sale occurred. Provided that such activities may be performed through the use of contracts, forest product sales, and cooperative agreements. Note that these activities are to be performed by contract and not Forest Service personnel. The Forest Service used this amendment to administratively create two K-V programs within the K-V fund; CWKV (Cooperative Work, Knutson-Vandenberg, Sale Area Projects) and CWK2 (Cooperative Work, Knutson-Vandenberg, Regional Projects). This layer shows the spatial representation where activities accomplished and funded with CWKV and CWK2 funds and reported through the Forest Service Activity Tracking System (FACTS) database. It is important to note that this layer may not contain all CWKV or CWK2 accomplished activities; the spatial portion of the activity description is not currently enforced by FACTS and at this time some are optionally reported by Forest Service units. As spatial data reporting is enforced by the application and acceptant of reporting both tabular and spatial we hope to improve the quality and comprehensiveness of the data used for this layer in coming years.�<a href=\"https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.Activity_KnutsonVandenberg.xml\" target=\"_blank\">Metadata</a>",

      "description": "Between 1987 and 1988, twenty-four approximately 2-acre plots were established in Jones County, Georgia on the Hitchiti Experimental Forest which is also known as the Brender Demonstration Forest. These plots have not burned since prior to 1939. Treatments were applied to track site changes over time from five short return interval underburn treatments. These treatments, replicated 4 times, were comprised of: biennial dormant season headfires, triennial dormant season headfires, triennial dormant season backfires, triennial growing season headfires, growing season headfires every 6 years, and unburned controls. Triennial dormant season treatments were eventually combined. Variables tracked over time include the impact of fire on overstory pine growth, midstory (in this study midstory includes understory plants &gt; 4.5 feet high) structure and composition, seedling (in this study including all woody plants &lt; 4.5 feet high and all other plants regardless of height) species dominance, percent cover, pine seedling establishment and mortality, and forest floor consumption. Several thousand overstory and midstory trees were tagged, GPS coordinates recorded and their survival and growth followed over time. Vegetation was measured in nested circular plots and on line transects. Live and dead overstory trees on two 0.2 acre (1/5 ac) subplots per treatment plot were tallied annually by species with diameter at breast height and height, measured and pest damage/mortality by pathogen, lightning and wind damage recorded. Basal area was calculated periodically. Some overstory pines were bored to determine age (typically after death). Midstory live and dead trees were tallied annually on six 0.02 acre subplots per treatment plot. Seedlings were tallied on eighteen 0.001 acre (MA = milacre) subplots per treatment plot by species/species group, and percent of the subplot area in vines, herbs, moss, live woody material, dead plant material, and void of plant material (exposed mineral soil). Six 33 feet line transects per treatment plot were divided into 6 inch segments and dominant seedling species/species group tallied annually. Over 150 species/species groups were identified and tracked over time. Weights of likely available live fuel were determined by species/species group prior to each burn, as were weights of likely available dead fuel for various categories/size classes. Paired postburn samples were collected to determine consumption of various fuel categories. Overstory and midstory pine crown scorch, foliage consumption, and hardwood mortality were tallied within two weeks following each burn. Other vegetation datasets include pine seedling establishment and survival over time on the 18 MA subplots per treatment plot. Red cockaded woodpecker (RCW) related information was collected annually by Region 8 (Southern Region) of the USFS and is available from them. Live and dead fuel moisture data were sampled prior to every burn and can include preburn moisture content grab samples, 10-hour fuel stick readings, and random lumber probe readings. Fire behavior records of headfires and backfires can include rate of spread, flame length, flame angle, flame zone depth, short distance spotting, slopovers, burnout time, and percent of plot burned. The study plan called for observations of fire residence time as well, but such observations were rarely recorded. Weather data include on-plot hand-held instrument observations of surface wind velocity, ambient temperature and relative humidity (RH). On-site data collected can include precipitation, ambient temperature, RH and wind traces from recording gauges. Keetch Byram Drought Index (KBDI) calculation and National Fire danger Rating System NFDRS predictions and other weather observations taken at two nearby Georgia Forestry Commission weather stations were also included.",

      "description": "The TrailNFS_Publish Layer is designed to provide information about National Forest System trail locations and characteristics to the public. When fully realized, it will describe trail locations, basic characteristics of the trail, and where and when various trail uses are prohibited, allowed and encouraged. Because the data readiness varies between Forests, each Forest will approve which level of attribute subset are published for that forest. Forests can provide no information or one of three attribute subsets describing trails. The attribute subsets include TrailNFS_Centerline which includes the location and trail name and number; TrailNFS_Basic which adds information about basic trail characteristics; and TrailNFS_Mgmt which adds information about where and when users are prohibited, allowed, and encouraged. When a Forest chooses to provide the highest attribute subset, TrailNFS_Mgmt, these attributes must be consistent with the Forest's published Motorized Vehicle Use Map (MVUM). Metadata for the individual Forest feature classes used to compile this feature class are available at data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/dir_trails.php. <a href=\"https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.TrailNFS_Publish.xml\" target=\"_blank\">Metadata</a>",

      "description": "NorWeST summer stream temperature scenarios were developed for all rivers and streams in the western U.S. from the &gt; 20,000 stream sites in the NorWeST database where mean August stream temperatures were recorded. The scenarios include: 1) Adobe PDF format maps depicting historical and future modeled mean August stream temperatures, 2) graphs (JPG format) demonstrating the accuracy of the temperature model, and 3) GIS shapefiles (SHP format) representing the spatially modeled stream temperatures. The GIS shapefiles include stream lines and associated mid-points representing 1 kilometer intervals along the stream network. Stream lines were derived from the 1:100,000 scale NHDPlus dataset (USEPA and USGS 2010; McKay et al. 2012). Shapefile extents correspond to NorWeST processing units, which generally relate to 6 digit (3rd code) hydrologic unit codes (HUCs) or in some instances closely correspond to state borders. The line and point shapefiles contain identical modeled stream temperature results. The two shapefile formats are meant to complement one another for use in different applications. In addition, spatial and temporal covariates used to generate the modeled temperatures are included in the shapefile attribute tables. The NorWeST NHDPlusV1 processing units include: Salmon, Clearwater, Spokoot, Missouri Headwaters, Snake-Bear, MidSnake, MidColumbia, Oregon Coast, South-Central Oregon, Upper Columbia-Yakima, Washington Coast, Upper Yellowstone-Bighorn, Upper Missouri-Marias, and Upper Green-North Platte. The NorWeST NHDPlusV2 processing units include: Lahontan Basin, Northern California-Coastal Klamath, Utah, Coastal California, Central California, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and Black Hills.",

      "description": "NorWeST is an interagency stream temperature database and model for the western United States containing data from over 20,000 unique stream locations. Temperature observations were solicited from state, federal, tribal, private, and municipal resource organizations and processed using a custom cleaning script developed by Gwynne Chandler. Summaries of daily, weekly, and monthly means, minima, and maxima are provided for observation years. The data summaries and location information are available in user-friendly file formats that include: 1) a map (PDF) depicting the locations of in-stream thermographs (temperature sensors) for each processing unit, 2) a GIS shapefile (SHP) containing the location of these sensors for each processing unit, and 3) a tabular file (XLSX) containing observed temperature database summaries for data generally ranging from 1993 to 2015, dependent on the processing unit. Each point shapefile extent corresponds to NorWeST processing units, which generally relate to 6 digit (3rd code) hydrologic unit codes (HUCs). The tabular data can be joined to the observation point shapefile using the ID field OBSPRED_ID. The NorWeST NHDPlusV1 processing units include: Salmon, Clearwater, Spokoot, Missouri Headwaters, Snake-Bear, MidSnake, MidColumbia, Oregon Coast, South-Central Oregon, Upper Columbia-Yakima, Washington Coast, Upper Yellowstone-Bighorn, Upper Missouri-Marias, and Upper Green-North Platte. The NorWeST NHDPlusV2 processing units include: Lahontan Basin, Northern California-Coastal Klamath, Utah, Coastal California, Central California, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and Black Hills.",

While the Rehabilitation study was conducted within two management units of the Compartment Management Study (CMS) the data for the Rehabilitation study are independent of the CMS. The Rehabilitation study examined two levels of intervention treatments against controls in two stands that had been subjected to repeated commercial clearcutting harvests, last occurring 20 and 25 years before. The intervention treatments were 1) moderate treatment, in which crop trees were identified and released, and 2) intensive treatment, in which crop trees were released, unacceptable growing stock was removed, and fill planting of red spruce was conducted. Data are available in seven data sets: 1) crop tree stem map; 2) crop tree DBH (diameter at breast height) and mortality; 3) crop tree heights; 4) overstory DClass (diameter at breast height class); 5) sapling DClass; 6) regeneration tally; and 7) overstory plot locations.",

We used the MACAv2-metdata monthly precipitation and minimum and maximum temperature datasets for the period 1975-2005 (historical) and 2071-2090 (RCP8.5, future). Average temperature was calculated as the arithmetic mean of minimum and maximum temperature datasets. Average temperature was averaged over the winter months (November through March) and precipitation was summed over the winter months.

      "description": "National burn probability (BP) and conditional fire intensity level (FIL) data were generated for the conterminous United States (US) using a geospatial Fire Simulation (FSim) system developed by the US Forest Service Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory to estimate probabilistic components of wildfire risk (Finney et al. [2011]). The FSim system includes modules for weather generation, wildfire occurrence, fire growth, and fire suppression. FSim is designed to simulate the occurrence and growth of wildfires under tens of thousands of hypothetical contemporary fire seasons in order to estimate the probability of a given area (i.e., pixel) burning under current landscape conditions and fire management practices. The data presented here represent modeled BP and FIL for the conterminous US at a 270-meter grid spatial resolution. The six FILs correspond to flame-length classes as follows: FIL1 = &lt; 2 feet (ft); FIL2 = 2 &lt; 4 ft.; FIL3 = 4 &lt; 6 ft.; FIL4 = 6 &lt; 8 ft.; FIL5 = 8 &lt; 12 ft.; FIL6 = 12+ ft. Because they indicate conditional probabilities (i.e., representing the likelihood of burning at a certain intensity level, given that a fire occurs), the FIL*_20160830 data must be used in conjunction with the BP_20160830 data for risk assessment.",

      "description": "The USDA Forest Service Rapid Assessment of Vegetation Condition after Wildfire (RAVG) program produces geospatial data and maps of post-fire vegetation condition using standardized change detection methods based on Landsat or similar multispectral satellite imagery. RAVG data products characterize vegetation condition within a fire perimeter, and include estimates of percent change in basal area (BA), percent change in canopy cover (CC), and a standardized composite burn index (CBI). Standard thematic products include 7-class percent change in basal area (BA-7), 5-class percent change in canopy cover (CC-5), and 4-class CBI (CBI-4). Contingent upon the availability of suitable imagery, RAVG products are prepared for all wildland fires reported within the conterminous United States (CONUS) that include at least 1000 acres of forested National Forest System (NFS) land (500 acres for Regions 8 and 9 as of 2016). Data for individual fires are typically made available within 45 days after fire containment (&quot;initial assessments&quot;). Late-season fires, however, may be deferred until the following spring or summer (&quot;extended assessments&quot;). National mosaics of each thematic product are prepared annually. Mosaics of extended assessments, if any, are provided separately from initial assessment mosaics. This map service includes annual raster mosaics of published BA-7 datasets for fires that burned during calendar years 2013 through 2016, excluding 2016 extended assessments. The associated burned area perimeters are available via the Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW, see https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/datasets.php).",

      "description": "This dataset is the official data for the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule (36 CFR 294, Subpart B). It contains the Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRA) that were used in the Final Environmental Impact Statement for the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule. The IRA data was originally submitted to the Geospatial Service and Technology Center (GSTC - Located in Salt Lake City Utah) by all national forests through their Regional Offices for the Forest Service?s Roadless Area Conservation Initiative. The data was consolidated at the GSTC and used in the Draft Environment Impact Statement. Between the draft and final stages of the Environmental Impact Statement, the data was updated by the forests to reflect any corrections to Inventoried Roadless Areas that were based on existing forest plans and administrative record. The data was also supplemented to include Special Designated Area information and to include Inventoried Roadless Areas within Special Designated Areas. The data was resubmitted to the GSTC on July 21, 2000 for consolidation and the completed coverage was used in the Roadless Area Conservation Final Environmental Impact Statement. IRAs are based on completed forest plans, forest plans in revision where the agency has established an inventory (this information should be available in Appendix C of most forest plans), or other assessments that are completed and adopted by the agency. RARE II (Roadless Area Review and Evaluation of 1977 and 1978) information was used in cases where a forest does not have a more current roadless inventory, which was established using RARE II information. <a href=\"https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.RoadlessArea_2001.xml\" target=\"_blank\">Metadata</a>",

      "description": "This data publication contains fire behavior package (FBP) data; primarily flame temperature, horizontal and vertical mass flow, fire intensity, as well as ocular rates of spread (ROS), wind speed and direction data from the Prescribed Fire Combustion and Atmospheric Dynamics Research Experiment (RxCADRE) project conducted in November, 2012. These experiments were conducted on 7 small replicate and 3 large operational prescribed burn blocks in longleaf pine ecosystems on Eglin Air Force Base in Okaloosa County, Florida. Data were collected using three separate sensor systems. The first included sensor/datalogger measurements of convective/radiant energy, temperature and mass flow released by the fire. The second was a digital video camera housed in a fire proof enclosure that recorded visual images of the fire behavior. The third was an array of broadly distributed HOBO micro station anemometers. Both FBP sensor packages and camera system were located nominally 0.5 meters above ground level. The anemometers were 3.05 meters above ground level. The raw data have been processed using calibration data and converted into engineering units. The data provides 10 Hz fire flux measurements (kW/m²), temperature (C), and mass flow (m/sec) in the vertical and horizontal direction per FBP. The anemometer data provide 1 second wind speed and direction as well as 3 second average wind spread, direction and maximum gust.",

      "description": "National burn probability (BP) and conditional fire intensity level (FIL) data were generated for the conterminous United States (US) using a geospatial Fire Simulation (FSim) system developed by the US Forest Service Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory to estimate probabilistic components of wildfire risk (Finney et al. [2011]). The FSim system includes modules for weather generation, wildfire occurrence, fire growth, and fire suppression. FSim is designed to simulate the occurrence and growth of wildfires under tens of thousands of hypothetical contemporary fire seasons in order to estimate the probability of a given area (i.e., pixel) burning under current landscape conditions and fire management practices. The data presented here represent modeled BP and FIL for the conterminous US at a 270-meter grid spatial resolution. The six FILs correspond to flame-length classes as follows: FIL1 = &lt; 2 feet (ft); FIL2 = 2 &lt; 4 ft.; FIL3 = 4 &lt; 6 ft.; FIL4 = 6 &lt; 8 ft.; FIL5 = 8 &lt; 12 ft.; FIL6 = 12+ ft. Because they indicate conditional probabilities (i.e., representing the likelihood of burning at a certain intensity level, given that a fire occurs), the FIL*_20160830 data must be used in conjunction with the BP_20160830 data for risk assessment.",

Additional data available include: effective energy and mass transfer (EEMT) and specific gravity (wood density) of woody species. Another data set, for the Pinaleño Mountains, is included in this publication. The data were collected as part of the RMRS Growth and Demography of the Pinaleño High Elevation Forests research project and the Critical Zone Observatory aerial lidar forest structure validation. The data include diameter at breast height, maximum vertical height, condition and species information; and laboratory-determined cross-dated tree establishment dates, age at collection, computed total biomass, and plot-level Effective Energy and Mass Transfer (EEMT) for each tree. Both of these data sets support Swetnam et al. 2016.",

      "description": "America's private forests provide a vast array of public goods and services, including abundant, clean surface water. Forest loss and development can affect water quality and quantity when forests are removed and impervious surfaces, such as paved roads, spread across the landscape. We rank watersheds across the conterminous United States according to the contributions of private forest land to surface drinking water and by threats to surface water from increased housing density. Private forest land contributions to drinking water are greatest in the East but are also important in Western watersheds. Development pressures on these contributions are concentrated in the Eastern United States but are also found in the North-Central region, parts of the West and Southwest, and the Pacific Northwest; nationwide, more than 55 million acres of rural private forest land are projected to experience a substantial increase in housing density from 2000 to 2030. Planners, communities, and private landowners can use a range of strategies to maintain freshwater ecosystems, including designing housing and roads to minimize impacts on water quality, managing home sites to protect water resources, and using payment schemes and management partnerships to invest in forest stewardship on public and private lands.This data is based on the digital hydrologic unit boundary layer to the Subwatershed (12-digit) 6th level for the continental United States. To focus this analysis on watersheds with private forests, only watersheds with at least 10% forested land and more than 50 acres of private forest were analyzed. All other watersheds were labeled ?Insufficient private forest for this analysis&quot;and coded -99999 in the data table. This dataset updates forest and development statistics reported in the the 2011 Forests to Faucet analysis using 2006 National Land Cover Database for the Conterminous United States, Grid Values=41,42,43,95. and Theobald, Dr. David M. 10 March 2008. bhc2000 and bhc2030 (Housing density for the coterminous US in 2000 and 2030, respectively.)
